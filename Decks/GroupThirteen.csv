H,,,,
B+NaOH->,Na3BO3+H2,"Effectively same as B+H2O->H2+H3BO3; H3BO3+NaOH->Na3BO3+H2O. Not metaborate, metaborate needs heating for anhydride links",Use oxide form,
Tl+I2(excess)->,TlI3,"TlI is expected, but I3- is formed similar to how peroxide is stabilized by higher elements in s block",,
Thermite Reaction,Al+O2->Al2O3,HUGE Amount of heat,,
Potash Alum - True Form,[K(H2O)6][Al(H2O)6](SO4)2,,,
2B2O3+P4O10,BPO4,B2O3 being weakly acidic can be forced to react by a strongly acidic oxide. B3+,,
Borax - True Form,Na2[H2B4O7(OH)2].8H2O,It is a lewis A-B derivative of H2B4O7,,
Orthoboric Acid,H3BO3,,,
Metaboric Acid,HBO2,Metaacid is when 2 anhydride links are formed. Ortho and Metaacids are Gross words. They are referring to emperical formula and not true structure.,,
Pyroboric Acid,H2B4O7,Pyroacid is when 1 H2O left. It is not a gross word and denotes a specific acid. But the guy who named Boron :clap: acids was a Moron :clap: and named H2B4O7 as pyroboric acid.,,
B2O3+NH4BF4,NH3+BF3+H2O,Effectively same as HF+B2O3,,
B-Compounds that give characteristic flame colour,BF3(green) B(OCH3)3(green),,,1
NaAlO2.2H2O+CO2->,"NaHCO3+Al(OH)3(ppt,gelatinous)",CO2 is more acidic than amphoteric,,
LiH+AlCl3,(AlH3)n,Tau Bonds; LiAlH4 is formed only with excess LiH,,
In+HCl->,In[InCl4],InCl2,,
Laboratory Preparation of Diborane,NaBH4+I2->B2H6+NaI,,(Not from BF3),
Laboratory Preparation of Diborane from BF3,NaBH4+BF3->B2H6+NaF,,(Not from BF3),
Production of Diborane from B2O3,B2O3+Al+H2->Al2O3+B2H6,"The huge heat from Al causes H2 to flame and instead of H2O, B2O3 forms",,
AlCl3+CH3MgCl->,MgCl2+Al2(CH3)6,Me shows Tau bonds too,,
B2H6+NH3(excess) (Extreme T)->,(BN)n,,Ignore byproducts,
B2H6+NH3,[BH2(NH3)2][BH4],,Use complex form,
B2H6+NH3 (Extreme T)->,B3N3H6,,Ignore byproducts,
