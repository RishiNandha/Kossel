KMnO4+▲->,K2MnO4(green)+MnO2(black)+O2,"KMnO4 to K2MnO4 is not that favourable a reaction, and moving to MnO2 has enough energy to initiate reverse of it.

Strong splitting Cr wont allow for assymetric eg Ni typically gives square planar with strong split, tetrahedral with weak split and octahedral with solvents (NH3 and H2O). d9 always show the eg assymetry. Ag generally likes 2 coordination only, this is just a rare case. NH3 exceptionally strong always for Co and this makes this another assymetric eg. Pt,Pd,Au which are d8 coinage metals are not really assymetric eg but give square planar always. Au(III) likes 4 coordination more than 2 unlike Au(I)",dsp2/sp3/sp3d2,3
