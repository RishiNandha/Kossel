Preperation of K2Cr2O7,FeCr2O4+Na2CO3+O2->Na2CrO4+H2SO4->Na2Cr2O7+KCl->K2Cr2O7,FeCr2O4 is found as ore FeO+Cr2O3 (Not FeCrO4). Cr2O7 is just CrO4 after making an anhydride link catalysed by acid. The first reaction is similar to Na2CO3 bead test in Oxidizing flame.,Add the reagants into reaction in the subsequent steps right away (For example like H2O in this reaction: RX+Mg->MgRX+H2O->RH+MgXOH). Ignore byproducts for this reaction. Ignore colours.,
K2Cr2O7+▲->,K2CrO4(yellow)+Cr2O3+O2,One of the Cr is going to stable ox state. The anhydride link is broken just like in N2O5. Generally pyrolysis driven by gas-ing or ppt-ing,,
Preparation of KMnO4,MnO2+KOH+O2->K2MnO4(green)+Cl2->KMnO4(purple),"MnO2 is found as ore. MnO4-- is stabilized in extremely basic medium, it servers as a good intermediate to move to MnO4-. Cl is used as its both a mild oxidizer and works against pH.",Add the reagants into reaction in the subsequent steps right away (For example like H2O in this reaction: RX+Mg->MgRX+H2O->RH+MgXOH). Ignore byproducts for this reaction.,
